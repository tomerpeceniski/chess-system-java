# About the Project

This project consists of a Chess Game developed during the course "Java and Object-Oriented Programming" at [DevSuperior School](https://devsuperior.com.br/). The objective was to train our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills by developing properties and moves for chess pieces, handling piece colors, and implementing game logic.

### Key Learnings:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes for different types of chess pieces and using inheritance for shared behavior.
- **Encapsulation**: Managing the state of the game and pieces through well-defined methods and keeping the internal logic hidden from the user.
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods to handle different chess piece movements.
- **Collections**: Using Java collections to store and manage the chessboard and game state.

Feel free to clone the repository and enjoy playing!
